# Detecting Synthetic Faces Generated by Text-to-Image Models Using Deep Learning


*Deep learning system to distinguish real faces from AI-generated synthetic faces*

## 🧠 Overview

In this project **Synthetic Faces** — refer to faces generated by AI generative models (diffusion-based text-to-image systems). This project proposes a hybrid deep learning pipeline to **detect synthetic (AI-generated) faces** using a combination of:

- 🧩 **VGG19** for **AI vs. Real face classification**
- 🧩 **YOLOv8** for **face detection**


## 🎯 Objective

Develop an effective detection system that distinguishes real human faces from AI-generated ones, especially those created using **text-to-image diffusion models**.
